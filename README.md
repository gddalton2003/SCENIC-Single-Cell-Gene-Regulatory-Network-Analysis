The paper presenting SCENIC as a package for the simultaneous reconstruction of gene regulatory networks and identification of cell states was published by the Stein Aerts laboratory in Nature Methods in 2017. SCENIC can be applied to single-cell RNA-Seq data to identify transcription factors that play a critical role in gene regulatory networks in cells, as well as cell states. SCENIC can critical biological insights into the mechanisms driving cellular heterogeneity. A file has been added with code use to run SCENIC analysis in R on single nuceleus RNA-Seq samples.
